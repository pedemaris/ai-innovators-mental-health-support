Project Ideas

Below are the top 2–3 concepts I explored for our AI Innovators Capstone Project.
Each idea focuses on allowing easier acces for people experiencing anxiety, panic, or emotional overwhelm 
by providing immediate, in-the-moment support.

1. CalmStep App (Main Idea)
A mobile wellness app designed to give users instant emotional regulation tools during moments
of panic, anxiety, or mental overload.

Key Features
  Face ID–secured app for privacy
  Quick options like:
    “I’m having a panic attack”
    “My thoughts are racing”
    “I feel overwhelmed”
  AI-guided grounding and breathing exercises that adjust based on symptoms
  Science-backed techniques for real-time stabilization
  Optional connection for therapists (if the user chooses) so they can view crisis patterns or symptom logs
  Built-in resource library for people who don’t know where to find help

Why It Works
When someone is in a crisis, they don’t have time to schedule an appointment, wait for callbacks, 
or search for coping tools. CalmStep gives them immediate support in seconds.

2. Panic Button Widget
A simplified version of CalmStep that lives directly on the lock screen or home screen.

How It Works
User taps the panic widget
  A voice or text-based chatbot immediately asks:
    “What’s going on right now?”
  Provides quick-tap symptom options
  AI walks the user through a tailored grounding protocol
  Audio mode for people in motion (ex: driving anxiety)

Why It Works
This concept supports situations where opening the full app isn’t realistic like
driving, being in crowded spaces, or experiencing sensory overload.

3. AI-Based Emotional Check-In Assistant
A calmer, daily-use companion that analyzes patterns over time.
Features
  Brief morning and evening check-ins
  AI identifies mood patterns, stressors, or warning signs
  Personalized suggestions like sleep routines, grounding exercises, or journaling prompts
  Optional weekly report for the user or their therapist
Why It Works
Many people don’t notice their symptoms building until they crash. 
This keeps them ahead of it, without judgment.

Summary
These ideas focus on the same mission: making mental health support immediate, accessible, and stigma-free.
For the project, I decided on CalmStep as the primary concept because it provides
the most unique real-time support while still being simple to use in moments of crisis.
