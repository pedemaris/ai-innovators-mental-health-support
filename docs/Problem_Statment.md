Problem Statement

Millions of people experience anxiety, panic, and emotional overwhelm every day, but most never receive support they need. Even though the mental illness stigma has shrunk in recent years, access to real help is still limited. Studies show that one in five U.S. adults struggle with mental illness each year, but more than half receive no treatment. Many people go undiagnosed for years due to stigma, financial barriers, lack of flexible scheduling, or simply not knowing where to get help. When symptoms peak—during a panic attack, a stress spike, or an emotional shutdown—traditional care systems don't have the resources respond in the moment.

This leaves individuals trying to manage intense symptoms alone, often with few tools and little guidance. The gap between “I’m struggling right now” and “my next appointment is weeks away” creates overwhelming symptoms that impact work, relationships, daily functioning, and overall quality of life.

The core problem here is that people need immediate, accessible, judgment-free support when symptoms come up not hours or days later. A digital tool that can meet users in real time, guide them through what they are experiencing, and help them regulate safely has the potential to bridge the gap and make mental health support more accessable and private.
