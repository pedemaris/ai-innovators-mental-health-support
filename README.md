# CalmStep — Support In The Moment  
AI Innovators Capstone Project (AAI 101)  
By Paige DeMaris
---

## 📌 Project Overview

**CalmStep** is an AI-assisted emotional support tool designed to help users through *in-the-moment* experiences of panic, overwhelm, or emotional dysregulation. Unlike long-form meditation or mood tracking apps, CalmStep provides fast, accessible grounding activities and gentle guidance that can be used during acute moments of distress.

This project demonstrates how natural language processing and rule-based AI can be implemented responsibly and safely for mental wellbeing support.

## 🧠 AI Method & Data Plan

CalmStep uses a lightweight intent-based NLP chatbot built in Google Dialogflow ES to:

- Recognize user emotional state through simple text inputs  
- Respond with grounding strategies (breathing, sensory focus, cognitive reframing)  
- Route to crisis resources when needed

Data plan highlights:
- No personal identifiers collected  
- Data kept minimal and anonymized  
- No clinical diagnoses or therapeutic claims  
- Designed to prioritize user privacy and safety

## 🧩 Ethical Considerations & Market Fit

**Privacy & Safety**
- Clears user expectations
- Minimal data collection
- No third-party sharing

**Non-Clinical**
- Supports regulation only
- Not a medical or therapy provider

**Bias & Fairness**
- Inclusive language
- No assumptions about culture or conditions

**Market Opportunity**
Most wellness apps focus on *long-term routines* or meditations. CalmStep fills a gap by offering *instant support* for users who can’t navigate complex menus while overwhelmed.
