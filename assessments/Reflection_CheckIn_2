For this phase, I focused on researching the top mental health apps to understand how they work, what AI methods they use, and where CalmStep can offer something different. 
I also explored color psychology to refine the CalmStep logo and make the design more anxiety-friendly. 
Finally, I reviewed privacy expectations for wellness apps to make sure the approach stays user focused and safe.
