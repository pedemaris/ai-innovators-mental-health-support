# Final Reflection — Paige DeMaris  
**AI Innovators Capstone Project (AAI 101)**

## What was your key contribution to the project?
My key contribution was completing the entire project independently. Due to some health challenges, I took on all roles myself 
— research, concept development, branding, AI strategy, slide creation, and the pitch video. Managing every component made the 
final product feel cohesive and intentional.

## Which AI concept or skill did you learn that you will apply in future courses or work?
The most valuable skill I learned was understanding how AI interprets and responds to human input — especially intent 
classification and prompt design. Building CalmStep required me to think about how AI recognizes emotional states, selects safe 
and appropriate responses, and avoids harmful output. I also gained a stronger foundation in responsible AI design, which will directly 
support my future programming and UX coursework.

## How did your team handle collaboration, decision-making, and ethical considerations?
Since I completed the project on my own, I treated research as my main collaborator. I explored several mental-health support apps,
studied UI patterns, and read crisis-support guidelines to inform my decisions. This helped me design CalmStep with a more universal, 
user-centered perspective. Ethical considerations shaped every part of the project — including crisis escalation paths, avoiding over-reliance on AI, 
and ensuring the tone stayed supportive rather than clinical or dismissive.

## What would you do differently with more time or resources?
With more time, I would develop CalmStep further: a functional prototype, basic backend logic, user testing, expanded branding, 
and even a marketing or rollout strategy. I’d also explore potential revenue models. Even so, this project was genuinely enjoyable, 
and it felt meaningful to design something aimed at real emotional support rather than just meeting an assignment requirement.
